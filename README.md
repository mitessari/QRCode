- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I leaned how to build a card using just CSS elements, as well as html components. I learned how to use the hover command and applying box-shadow to my card element, making it look more professional. I also practise how to link Google fonts to the HTML and style them on the CSS. And finally I learned how to make the site responsive setting the viewport.

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    font-family: "Outfit", sans-serif;
  }

  .card hover {
    box-shadow: 0px 16px 24px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
  }
}
```

### Continued development

The project helped me realize that regarding CSS I still need some practise on areas like Box Model, display values, positions and colors. Although I notice some increase on my skills involving font styles. I also notice some difficulty involving using classes on HTML however I notice a good understanding on how link fonts, images and URLs on HTML.
